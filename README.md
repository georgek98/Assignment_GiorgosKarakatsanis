Snake game test for TrueMyth Games

My code solution for this test was to have a txt file to read and write the top score achieved and a CSV file to read the different colours and points for the food.
Food point combo scales with amount of same colour fruit collected.

I have used prefabs for fruits and snake body to avoid repetition and to make it easier to adapt Game Object wherever needed.
